# SQL Project README

## Project Overview
This project encompasses the design, implementation, and analysis of a SQL database system based on the provided instructions. It is divided into three main parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

## Data Modeling
- Utilized the provided CSV files to sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) depicting the relationships between various entities within the database.
- Employed tools like QuickDBD to facilitate the creation of the ERD.

## Data Engineering
- Created table schemas for each of the six CSV files, ensuring adherence to the provided instructions.
- Considered data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints during schema design.
- Ensured uniqueness for primary keys and implemented composite keys where necessary.
- Created tables in the correct order to handle foreign key dependencies.
- Imported each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table to populate the database.

## Data Analysis
Performed the following data analysis tasks:
- Listed employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
- Listed first name, last name, and hire date for employees hired in 1986.
- Listed the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
- Listed the department number for each employee along with their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- Listed first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
- Listed each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
- Listed each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- Computed frequency counts, in descending order, of all employee last names to determine how many employees share each last name.


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to designing, implementing, and analyzing a SQL database system based on the provided instructions. From data modeling and engineering to insightful data analysis, each aspect has been meticulously addressed, resulting in a functional and efficient solution for managing employee information within an organization.
